For this task we want to you design and code a mockup Online Trading platform.
The platform should fulfill the following requirements:

- an overview page where the user can see his current portfolio as well as its current
value and a Trend graph for the portfolio that updates in real time (refreshes with a
given interval). 
- a buy and sell page where the user can spend money buying assets (the user
should start with a given amount $100 000) and it should be decremented or
incremented depending upon the users selling and buying of stocks.
